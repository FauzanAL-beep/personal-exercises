make sure you have installed python 3.6 and packages below:
- NLTK
- Sastrawi

If you haven't installed it, you should install it with this command:

python -m pip install nltk
python -m pip install sastrawi

When you have installed it, run the main.py file to train and make the model (note that this might take a long time, on my environment this takes around 2.5 hours)

If you want to test with your own input, run the test.py file and input your sentence.
